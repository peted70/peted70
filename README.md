Hi, I'm Pete and love working on all aspects of 3D graphics but mostly in the immersive spatial computing space!

> My favourite tech includes: Mixed Reality, HoloLens, Unity, Unreal Engine, DirectX, Blender, Azure

Dedicated to helping companies large and small solve big spatial computing problems or just to get off the ground and work out a way forward.
